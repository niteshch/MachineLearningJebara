Stochastic Gradient Descent
=====================

In this problem, I tried to compare 3 different methods, gradient descent and two diâ†µerent flavors of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). For SGD, I used p random points to estimate the gradient in each round and experimented with p = 1 and p = 100.
